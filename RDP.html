        <h2>My Experience</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>In June 2023, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in an extremely unique programme, known
            as the Research and Development Programme (RDP) held by the CRADLE research department by Science Centre.
            This 2-week-long, 9 am - 5 pm programme was a unique experience where students from Secondary three to Junior
            College level are mentored by professors, researchers, and engineers to ideate and innovate unique solutions
            to solve real-world problems, not just by coming up with a proposal, but a minimal viable product (MVP) a
            working prototype of our proposed solutions. My team and I, representing SST, were tasked to come up with a
            smart aquaponics system suitable for urban settings such as Singapore. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p><br> Firstly, We learnt to operate heavy machinery such as the industrial laser cutter as well as 3D
            printers, while learning skills such as woodworking, soldering, wiring, all essential skills in order to
            create a smart product.</br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p><br>Next, We had to ideate, we took inspiration from the vertical farm systems found in Singapore as well as
            the aquaponics farms that we see on the roofs of Carparks. We modeled our prototype digitally using a 3D
            modeling software. <br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>Lastly, we went around the lab to acquire our components that were needed for the prototype, from motors,
            pipes, solar panels etc. We then built the frame of the aquaponics system, with the tubing properly
            installed. Then, we had to wire the electrical systems to a breadboard and store them in a safe place, the
            electronics included water detectors, pumps, LED lights as well as a connection to the solar panel. The idea
            was to have this as an independent system that can operate on its own, the solar panel would provide
            electrical energy to the system and the system would run on its own with a microcontroller and
            pre-programmed code, making this system versatile and modular. </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>In the end, the experience was really unique and I am grateful enough to have been given the opportunity to
            embark on this project. From this programme, I also had many things to reflect on, such as an improvement in
            my presentation skills, engineering skills, programming skills, networking skills, teamwork, leadership,
            ideation and coordination skills. All of which I hope to be able to bring forward and apply them with
            greater frequency in the future to sharpen my proficiency on these essential skills.</p>
