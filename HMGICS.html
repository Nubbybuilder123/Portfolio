        <p>In December 2023, I was one of a few fortunate individuals who were selected by SST to go to the newly established Hyundai 
            Motor Group Innovation Centre Singapore (HMGICS) for a work attachment. The 3 day long programme was an insightful one where 
            I got to learn about the history of the Hyundai Company, whilst also understanding more about their business model, touring 
            the factory and R&D centres as well as how they operated as an organisation. As part of the work attachment, we were guided by 
            our mentors and were tasked in coming up with a new way to heighten the Customer Experience (CX) of HMGICS. My team and I eventually 
            came up with a solution to integrate up and coming technologies such as Virtual Reality as well as Robotics, something Hyundai 
            specialises in, to keep children of the visitors entertained, allowing parents to have uninterrupted time to tour the factory and make 
            decisions in purchasing a vehicle. Furthermore, we planned to enhance the customer tour experience with the introduction of robots as 
            tour guides to provide a unique and futuristic experience whilst also reducing manpower demand on the tour segment, allowing Hyundai to 
            focus their resources elsewhere. </p>

        <p>Through this experience, I have been very fortunate and grateful to my teachers and mentors for allowing me to experience such a unique interaction.
             I have gained greater insight into things such as company recruitment requirements, industrial operations, importance of an integrated network of 
             smart sensors in an industrial setting and most importantly, interaction and networking with professionals more in depth in the customer experience 
             and human resource aspect in planning, considering and curating an unforgettable experience for customers. </p>
