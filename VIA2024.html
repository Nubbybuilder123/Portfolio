        <h2>My Experience</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>As part of a yearly tradition, every upper secondary class in SST is required to conduct a service learning project of sorts to deepen our connection and understanding whilst serving the community. As such, my class decided to go to willing hearts to prepare and pack food in a soup kitchen to give back to the community and help those in need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p><br> Willing hearts is a non-profitable organisation run by volunteers that prepares cooks and distributes about 7000 daily meals islandwide. We chose to volunteer at Willing Hearts as they were full run by volunteers, with actvities that required little training and had a genuinely meaningful impact on the community. At willing hearts, our large class was able to fulfill manpower needs by helping out in every part of the soup kitchen aside the cooking stations, we washed and prepared rice, vegetables, fish, meat, whilst also packing cooked dishes into plastic boxes that were meant to be distributed.</br></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>Volunteering at Willing Hearts has opened my worldview, it has shown me how many people were in desperate need of aid in Singapore, the kindness and empathy of volunteers at Willing Hearts, people who were willing to take out precious time in their free time to volunteer and help out those in need, the amount of consideration in preparing food that the benefeciaries can consume as well as the passion that everyone had. I made me grateful that there were such people helping others in need. Through this experience, I was able to also improve my coordination skills when getitng the class to plan for the session.</p>
