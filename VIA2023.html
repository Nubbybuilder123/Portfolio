        <h2>My Experience</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>In February 2023, as part of the upper secondary's class service learning project where the school aims for students to serve the community through these projects, my class decided to carry out a beach cleanup at east coast park. We chose a beach cleanup because we had the manpower to have a significant impact on the beach through direct service, making the beach a cleaner place for all. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p><br>Before we could conduct the actual cleanup, we had to submit a proposal to the schoolboard, including logistical planning on the date and equipment needed while requesting NParks for permission to clean the beaches.</br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p><br>Next, on the day of the beach cleanup itself, we spent 4 hours cleaning up the beach, covering a large section of East Coast Park. What I was surprised to find is that there were many forms of trash, from abandoned food, random vases, flip-flops and cigarette butts, I was not expecting a beach to be this heavily polluted by Singaporeans. <br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="heading1">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        <p>This experience enabled me to improve my leadership skills, where I had to lead the class with my form teacher and fellow ACE leader in the project, as well as my planning skills for large events such as these to distribute workload amongst classmates and prepare for the event logistically. It has also enabled me to appreciate the work cleaners put in to keep Singapore clean, it was not easy to clean that much trash from the beach and it made me amazed at how much effort our cleaners put to keeping our nation clean.</p>
